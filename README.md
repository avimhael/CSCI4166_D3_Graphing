#### This is best run using a local server to view - MAMP or something similar. 
#### Simple run your server and browse to localhost (or your htdocs folder).
#### When you have the list of files here, simply browser into the directory and view.

#### File.doc is a dummy file to emulate the downloading of a file via the download button on the left of the page

## Notes:

#### Mostly complete. Did not attempt the 'stack of papers' in the top-left graphic for lack of time. Had an issue #### displaying the percentage values on the horizontal bar graph at the bottom. I got them to print, but not to #### display with each of their respective bars. 

#### Was following / modifying an existing implementation of the tornado graph found here by Lucas Matteis using #### V3 of D3.js : https://bl.ocks.org/lmatteis/d0f7533895da2e59cd6f62f3589fd8eb
#### I managed to get it updated and working with V6 of D3.js but ran out of time for further work. It displays at #### the bottom of the poster and not formatted to look like the rest of the poster.

#### Learned a lot this assignment, thanks!
